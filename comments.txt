Thala  looking  mass.
Last part music I love it.
Yellam great. 
Little disappointed.
Super.
Looking young.
It is a little bit dissapointing.
The last scene was terrified.
I feel confused.
I don't like sad endings.
I'm mad about the writer.
I'm eager to watch the next movie of this director.
I think it is same like pink movie.
